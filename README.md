# TMD-Project
Tech, Media &amp; Democracy Project

## Proposal for Project 1:
We are analyzing Donald Trump’s tweets within the last month (02-25-18/03-25-18), and compare it to the past 30 days' news headlines from major news outlets. We look at a wide-variety of news sources ranging anywhere from conservative to liberal. Including anything from Breitbart to New York Times. We use http://newsapi.org to access the headlines and aggregate them. We use trumptwitterarchive.com to get the tweets (since Twitter API does not allow for accessing the past week). In essence we will look at the coverage of Trump’s tweets, and analyze whether they lead to an increase in news coverage.

### Source for tweets: http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive
